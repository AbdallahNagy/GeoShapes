# GeoShapes

by using c++ and the concepts of OOP i was able to make a parent class (shape) and 
triangle, rectangle, circle inherit from this class and square class which inherit 
from rectangle class which make more sence.

and we get the area of each shape.

so by practicing the oop concepts i recognized that it enables you to right a well-structured
and bugs-free code. because every part of the code does it's thing and it's very hard
for bugs to hide.
